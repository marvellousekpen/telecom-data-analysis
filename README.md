# Telecom Data Analysis

This project explores customer behavior and communication effectiveness within a simulated Nigerian telecom dataset. Inspired by a real-world challenge encountered as a telecom user, the goal is to uncover insights that can help telecom providers improve how they manage user engagement, especially around NIN (National Identification Number) linkage and promotional campaigns.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset used is a **mock telecom dataset** generated to mimic Glo Nigeria users. It contains 1,000 rows and fields such as:

- `full_name`: Name of the user
- `phone_number`: Nigerian Glo numbers (e.g. 0815, 0915, etc.)
- `location`: City of the user
- `is_active`: Whether the user is currently active
- `nin_linked`: Whether the user has linked their NIN
- `nin_reminder_call`: Whether the user received a call reminder about NIN
- `campaign_type`: Type of campaign received (Promo, Survey, App Download, etc.)
- `plan_type`: Type of plan subscribed (Yakata, Berekete, Glo Everyday, etc.)

##  Key Questions Answered (PostgreSQL)

Here are some key business questions answered using PostgreSQL:

1. **How many users received a NIN call even after linking their NIN?**
2. **How many users received different campaigns after completing the required action?**
3. **What locations have the highest cases of unnecessary follow-up communication?**
4. **Which plan types are mostly subscribed by inactive users?**
5. **Which campaign had the highest success in converting inactive users to active ones?**

> All queries are stored in `telecom_queries.sql`.

##  Insight Highlight

> ‚ÄúAs a regular Glo user, I noticed that even after linking my NIN, I still received repeated calls asking me to do the same. That made me realize there might be a gap in how customer data is being used.‚Äù

This project attempts to highlight such gaps and recommend ways Glo can better segment, track, and personalize communications.

##  Tools Used
